It's about finding <strong>tiny tools</strong> that quietly do the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>Here are 5 small, low-cost tools I use every day that have a huge impact on productivity, clarity, and consistency.</p>\n<h5><strong>1. CleanShot X — Best Screenshot Tool (Mac)</strong></h5>\n<p>More than screenshots. I use it to annotate, blur sensitive info, and record quick screen videos with audio. It saves hours in back-and-forth messages.</p>\n<p><strong>Time saved:</strong> ~30 min/day</p>\n<h5><strong>2. Typedesk — Canned Response System</strong></h5>\n<p>Creates shortcuts for repeat replies. Emails, DMs, proposals — done in seconds. I use <code>/followup</code> and <code>/proposal</code> daily to respond faster with consistency.</p>\n<p><strong>Time saved:</strong> ~15 min/day</p>\n<h5><strong>3. Notion Web Clipper</strong></h5>\n<p>I use this to save articles, ideas, and research into Notion with one click. Paired with a “Read Later” board, it keeps my browser clean and brain organized.</p>\n<p><strong>Time saved:</strong> ~20 min/day (and less context switching)</p>\n<h5><strong>4. Cron Calendar</strong></h5>\n<p>A minimal, beautiful calendar (now part of Notion) that makes time-blocking frictionless. Drag-and-drop, command palette, keyboard nav — all super fast.</p>\n<p><strong>Time saved:</strong> ~10 min/day planning + better focus</p>\n<h5><strong>5. Raycast — Mac Spotlight on Steroids</strong></h5>\n<p>Quickly launch apps, run scripts, convert units, check weather, or do math — all from a shortcut. My hands barely leave the keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Time saved:</strong> Hard to quantify — but feels like magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Total time saved:</strong> 1–2 hours per day. These tools are so embedded in my workflow that I notice instantly when one breaks or lags.</p>\n<h5>You should also read:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.timestacked.com/the-99-tech-stack-that-replaces-a-2500month-team.html\">The $99 Tech Stack That Replaces a $2,500/month Team</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.timestacked.com/ai-tools-i-use-weekly-and-what-i-ditched.html\">AI Tools I Use Weekly (and What I Ditched)</a></li>\n</ul>",
